# Medical-Insurance-Fraud-Detection-Minor-Project-II

Medical insurance fraud is a serious problem that can cost insurance companies and patients billions of dollars each year. Some known fraud types in health insurance sector are as follows: 
●	Charging excessive prices for a treatment or medicine in a health center. 
●	An unusually high number of invoices for a particular insurer in a short time frame.
●	Insurance transaction(s) where the insurer has got some treatment or medicine but either has not paid any installments or has paid only the first installment. 
●	Cases where the insurer buys medicine without medical examination. 
●	Claiming medical invoices with dates prior to or after than the beginning of the insurance period (this is permitted in some cases). 
●	Excessive number of medicine claims in a specific period. 
●	Bank account number changes of a business partner such as agency, health center or pharmacy. 
●	Excessive numbers of manual invoice demand whose amounts are smaller than the usual inspection limit. 
●	Claims whose payable amounts are greater than the invoice amounts that the insurance company will pay.
