# Medical Insurance Fraud Detection

## Project Overview:

This project focuses on developing machine learning models to detect fraudulent activities within the medical insurance industry. Medical insurance fraud poses a significant financial burden on healthcare systems and insurance companies. This project aims to utilize data analysis and machine learning techniques to identify patterns and anomalies indicative of fraudulent claims, such as inflated billing, unnecessary procedures, and false diagnoses. By developing and implementing effective fraud detection systems, we can help reduce financial losses, improve the integrity of the healthcare system, and ensure fair and equitable access to healthcare for all. Â  

This overview emphasizes the critical nature of medical insurance fraud detection and highlights the project's objective of mitigating this issue through the use of machine learning.

## Project Features: 
* Data sources: THe dataset contains insurance claims data, patient records, provider information. 
* Machine learning models: It uses decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, principal component analysis algorithms to train model.
* Fraud detection techniques: outlier detection, pattern recognition, anomaly detection, network analysis.
* Evaluation metrics: It uses paramteres like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC to measure performace of model.
